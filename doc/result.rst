:Gene_Symbol:
	Gene symbol affected by the SAV

:Sample_Name:
	Samples having the SAV

:Mutation_Key:
	{chromosome},{position},{reference allele},{alternative allele}

:Motif_Pos:
	The position of disrupted or newly created splicing motif ({chromosome}:{start}-{end})

:Mutation_Type:
	Splicing donor dirsuption, splicing acceptor disruption, splicing donor creation or splicing acceptor creation

:Is_Canonical:
	Whether the SAV is disruption or creating GT-AG canonical splicing motif, or not

:Splicing_Key:
	The position of splicing junction (for exon-skip, alternative splice site), or exon-intron boundary (for intron retention)

:Is_Inframe:
	Whether the new transcript generated by the SAV is inferred to be in-frame or not. (non applicable for intron retention)

:Supporting_Read_Num:
	The number of supporting reads for the transcript associated by the SAV

:Score:
	The Averaged Bayes Factor for the SAV

:Q_Value:
